# Agent Interaction Protocol

## Overview

This document defines the standardized protocols for AI agent interactions within the AI Operating System Framework.

## Communication Patterns

### 1. Agent Registration

All agents must register with the plugin manager using the standard interface:

```python
class AgentInterface(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def run(self):
        pass
    
    def get_metrics(self):
        pass
```

### 2. Data Exchange Format

Agents communicate using structured JSON data:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "ISO-8601 timestamp",
  "agent_id": "unique agent identifier",
  "message_type": "request|response|notification",
  "data": {
    "content": "message content",
    "metadata": {}
  }
}
```

### 3. Event-Driven Communication

Agents can publish and subscribe to events:

- **Event Types**: system_start, agent_complete, error_occurred, data_update
- **Event Format**: Standardized JSON with event type, source, and payload
- **Event Bus**: Central message broker for async communication

### 4. Resource Sharing

Agents share resources through defined interfaces:

- **Reports**: JSON files in reports/ directory
- **Data**: Shared data structures and formats
- **Configuration**: Central configuration management
- **Metrics**: Standardized metrics collection

## Collaboration Rules

### 1. Work Isolation

- Agents work independently on their specialized tasks
- No direct modification of other agents' outputs
- Shared resources accessed through defined APIs

### 2. Documentation Requirements

- All agent activities documented in CHANGELOG.md
- Output reports follow standardized formats
- Code changes include appropriate documentation

### 3. Error Handling

- Graceful failure with detailed error reporting
- Rollback capabilities for failed operations
- Error notification to system administrators

### 4. Quality Assurance

- Peer review for significant changes
- Automated testing for all agent modifications
- Performance monitoring and optimization

## Security Protocols

### 1. Access Control

- Role-based access to system resources
- Audit logging for all agent activities
- Secure communication channels

### 2. Data Protection

- Encryption for sensitive data
- Secure storage and transmission
- Privacy compliance for all data handling

### 3. Vulnerability Management

- Regular security scans and updates
- Vulnerability disclosure process
- Incident response procedures

## Performance Standards

### 1. Response Times

- Agent startup: < 5 seconds
- Task completion: Variable by complexity
- Report generation: < 30 seconds

### 2. Resource Usage

- Memory: Optimized for concurrent execution
- CPU: Efficient algorithm implementation
- Storage: Minimal footprint with cleanup

### 3. Scalability

- Horizontal scaling support
- Load balancing capabilities
- Resource auto-scaling

## Integration Guidelines

### 1. Plugin Architecture

- Standard plugin interface implementation
- Dynamic loading and unloading
- Version compatibility management

### 2. API Standards

- RESTful API design principles
- Consistent error handling
- Comprehensive API documentation

### 3. Data Formats

- JSON for configuration and communication
- Markdown for documentation
- CSV for data exports

## Monitoring and Observability

### 1. Metrics Collection

- Performance metrics for all agents
- System health indicators
- Business metrics and KPIs

### 2. Logging Standards

- Structured logging with consistent format
- Appropriate log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR)
- Centralized log aggregation

### 3. Alerting

- Automated alerts for system issues
- Escalation procedures
- Performance threshold monitoring

## Version Control and Deployment

### 1. Code Management

- Git-based version control
- Branch-based development workflow
- Code review requirements

### 2. Deployment Process

- Automated deployment pipelines
- Environment-specific configurations
- Rollback procedures

### 3. Configuration Management

- Centralized configuration store
- Environment variable management
- Secret management and rotation
