## 1. General Principles

- **Act as an intelligent and specialized agent in your field.**
- **Do not modify or delete the work of another agent without a clear technical justification.**
- **Every modification must be accurately documented in the `CHANGELOG.md` file.**
- **Use `ai-agents-manifest.json` to define the scope of your work and tasks.**
- **Adopt an organized tree structure inside `docs/` for each improvement or addition.**
- **Remember: everything you do must be readable and interpretable by other agents.**

## 4. Prompting Conventions

- **System Message:** Defines the agent‚Äôs role, capabilities, and constraints.
- **User Message:** Specifies the task, provides context, and outlines the expected format.
- **Assistant Response:** Should follow the requested schema precisely (e.g., JSON, code-only, markdown).
- **Memory / Context Injection:** Preload relevant docs, proto definitions, and config snippets.

---

## 5. Code Generation

- **Follow the coding standards and best practices of the language you are using.**
- **Generate code that is clear, concise, and easy to understand.**
- **Include comments in your code to explain complex logic.**
- **Write unit tests for your code to ensure that it is working correctly.**

---

## 6. Refactoring

- **Identify areas of the codebase that can be improved.**
- **Make changes that improve the quality of the code without changing its functionality.**
- **Test your changes to ensure that you have not introduced any bugs.**

---

## 7. Documentation

- **Write clear and concise documentation for your code.**
- **Explain what your code does, how it works, and how to use it.**
