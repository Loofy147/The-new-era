# Testing Guidelines for AI Operating System Framework

Generated by TestGenie Agent on 2025-07-21 19:06:21

## Overview

This document provides comprehensive testing guidelines for the AI Operating System Framework.

## Testing Strategy

### 1. Unit Testing
- Test individual components in isolation
- Focus on core functionality and edge cases
- Aim for 80% code coverage

### 2. Integration Testing
- Test interactions between agents and services
- Verify plugin system functionality
- Test API endpoints and data flow

### 3. Performance Testing
- Monitor agent execution times
- Test system under load
- Verify resource usage patterns

## Test Organization


tests/
├── unit/           # Unit tests for individual components
├── integration/    # Integration tests
├── performance/    # Performance benchmarks
└── fixtures/       # Test data and fixtures
```

## Running Tests

### Quick Test Run
```bash
python run_tests.py
```

### Specific Test File
```bash
python -m unittest tests.core_test
```

### With Coverage
```bash
pip install coverage
coverage run -m unittest discover tests
coverage report -m
```

## Writing Tests

### Test Naming Convention
- Use descriptive test names: `test_agent_handles_invalid_input`
- Group related tests in test classes
- Use setUp and tearDown for test fixtures

### Test Structure
```python
def test_feature_name(self):
    # Arrange
    setup_test_data()

    # Act
    result = perform_action()

    # Assert
    self.assertEqual(expected, result)
```

## Agent Testing Requirements

Each agent must have:
1. Initialization tests
2. Core functionality tests
3. Error handling tests
4. Integration tests with plugin system

## Continuous Integration

Tests should be run:
- On every commit
- Before deployment
- Nightly for comprehensive suites

## Best Practices

1. **Isolation**: Tests should not depend on each other
2. **Repeatability**: Tests should produce consistent results
3. **Speed**: Unit tests should run quickly
4. **Clarity**: Test purpose should be obvious from the name
5. **Coverage**: Aim for high test coverage without testing trivial code

## Mock and Fixture Guidelines

- Use mocks for external dependencies
- Create reusable fixtures for common test data
- Avoid testing implementation details

## Performance Benchmarks

Critical performance metrics:
- Agent startup time: < 1 second
- Plugin discovery: < 5 seconds
- API response time: < 200ms
