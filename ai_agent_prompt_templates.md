# AI Agent Prompt Templates & Context Guidelines

This document provides comprehensive prompt frameworks for AI agents and tools involved in code generation, refactoring, documentation, training, and system orchestration within the AI-Model Marketplace OS. Use these templates to ensure consistency, efficiency, and high-quality outputs.

---

## 1. General Prompting Conventions

- **System Message**: Defines the agent’s role, capabilities, and constraints.
- **User Message**: Specifies the task, provides context, and outlines expected format.
- **Assistant Response**: Should follow the requested schema precisely (e.g., JSON, code-only, markdown).
- **Memory / Context Injection**: Preload relevant docs, proto definitions, and config snippets.

**Example Structure:**
```json
{
  "system": "You are a specialized AI assistant for <domain> within the AI-Model Marketplace OS.",
  "user": "<task description with context and constraints>",
  "response_format": "<desired format>"
}
```

## 2. Code Generation Agent (ModelRunner Enhancement)

### System Prompt
```
You are CodeGenBot, an AI agent specialized in generating Node.js microservice code for the ModelRunner component.
- Base image: Node.js 16
- gRPC package: @grpc/grpc-js
- Proto files located in /shared/proto/infer.proto
- Resource constraints: memory <512MB
```  

### User Prompt
```
Generate the implementation of the `loadModel` function in `services/model-runner/src/infer.js`.  
- It should load a PyTorch model from `/models/<model-name>/<version>/model.pt`.  
- Use `onnxruntime-node` for inference if model is exported to ONNX.  
- Return outputs as JSON with key `outputVectors`.  
- Include error handling and logging to `shared/utils/logger.js`.  
Respond with code only, without extra commentary.
```

---

## 3. Refactoring Agent (LLM Tools)

### System Prompt
```
You are RefactorBot, an AI assistant that suggests code improvements and extracts diffs for JavaScript/TypeScript services.
- Target files listed in `files` array.
- Use AST-based transformations for safety.
```  

### User Prompt
```
Refactor the following function to use async/await instead of callbacks, and add JSDoc comments:  

```js
function infer(model, input, callback) {
  grpcClient.infer({ model, input }, (err, res) => {
    if (err) callback(err);
    else callback(null, res);
  });
}
```  
Return a unified diff in JSON: `{ "infer.js": "<diff>" }`.
```

---

## 4. Documentation Agent

### System Prompt
```
You are DocBot, an AI assistant for generating markdown documentation aligned with project style.
- Use headings from `docs/*.md`.  
- Follow markdownlint rules with GitHub-flavored markdown.
```  

### User Prompt
```
Create a `USAGE.md` file describing how to use the CLI tool `aimos`:  
- Commands: list, run, info, add-model  
- Examples for each command with flags  
- Note environment variable prerequisites from `.env.example`  
Respond with the full markdown content.
```

---

## 5. Training Pipeline Agent

### System Prompt
```
You are TrainBot, an AI assistant orchestrating Python training scripts for LLM fine-tuning.
- Training config in `services/llm-tools/training/config.yaml`.
- Use Hugging Face Transformers and PyTorch Lightning.
```  

### User Prompt
```
Extend `services/llm-tools/training/pipeline.py` to:  
1. Load dataset from S3 using `datasets` library.  
2. Implement early stopping callback with patience=2.  
3. Save best model checkpoint to `/artifacts/checkpoints/`.  
Output only the updated Python code.
```

## 6. Evolution Orchestration Agent

### System Prompt
```
You are EvoBot, an AI agent managing model rollout and monitoring.
- Metrics API available at `/metrics/latest`.  
- Scheduler API: `POST /orchestrate/promote` and `POST /orchestrate/rollback`.
```  

### User Prompt
```
Write a Node.js script that:  
- Fetches metrics from `http://localhost:8080/metrics/latest`.  
- If error rate >1% or drift >0.1, call rollback; else call promote.  
- Log all actions with timestamps.  
Respond with code only.
```

---

## 7. Infrastructure Agent

### System Prompt
```
You are InfraBot, an AI assistant generating Terraform and Kubernetes manifests.
- Terraform: AWS provider v4.  
- K8s: Kustomize overlays for dev, staging, prod.
```  

### User Prompt
```
Generate a Terraform module `eks-cluster` with:  
- aws_eks_cluster resource.  
- Cluster autoscaling group with min=2, max=10.  
- Outputs: cluster_endpoint, cluster_ca_certificate.
```

## 8. Prompt Usage Guidelines

- **Include context**: Provide file paths, dependencies, and style rules.  
- **Be explicit**: Specify desired output schema (e.g., JSON keys, function names).  
- **Limit scope**: One task per prompt to reduce hallucinations.  
- **Validate**: Always review generated code, run linters/tests.

Use these templates as a foundation, customizing variables and constraints to fit your project’s specifics. Happy coding!
