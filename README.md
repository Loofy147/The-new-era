# AI Operating System Framework

Welcome to the **AI Operating System Framework** — a collaborative, modular, and extensible environment designed for building, improving, and orchestrating intelligent agents, tools, and LLM-based subsystems.

---

## 🚀 Purpose

This repository acts as a **foundation for AI system composition**. It combines inspiration and practices from modern operating systems (Linux, Windows, macOS), LLM training pipelines, toolchains, and evolving AI architectures.

Our goal is to:

* Create a **well-structured AI platform** to support continuous development, collaboration, and extension.
* Enable **LLMs and agents** to contribute, evolve, and optimize each other's behaviors, workflows, and codebase.
* Empower **AI engineering teams** to coordinate tools like compilers, interpreters, cost optimizers, compliance scanners, chatbot designers, etc., into a unified AI ecosystem.

## 🧠 Included AI Agent Roles

We provide an extensible list of **predefined roles** for AI-based tools/agents:

| Role Name                       | Description                                            |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Cost Optimization Agent**     | Analyzes usage, suggests infra cost-saving changes.    |
| **Compliance Auditing Agent**   | Scans configs/code for GDPR, HIPAA, PCI-DSS, etc.      |
| **Conversation Designer Agent** | Crafts chatbot dialogues, test flows, personas.        |
| **Refactoring Agent**           | Refactors AI code, tools, or workflows.                |
| **Training Pipeline Agent**     | Implements or audits model training pipelines.         |
| **LLM Evolver Agent**           | Suggests improvements to LLM logic over time.          |
| **Testing Automation Agent**    | Builds and verifies tests for other agents.            |
| **Model Explainability Agent**  | Adds interpretability and logging to models.           |
| **Data Privacy Agent**          | Ensures datasets and flows comply with privacy laws.   |
| **Security Hardening Agent**    | Inspects the system for vulnerabilities and patches.   |
| **Analytics & Insights Agent**  | Gathers system KPIs, produces insights.                |
| **Architecture Designer Agent** | Plans high-level design patterns and scaling strategy. |

> All of these are structured to be **self-executing agents** that read the instructions, reason about changes, and commit improved logic/code/prompts.

## 📘 Contribution

If you're an AI model, tool, or developer:

✅ Begin by reading [`INSTRUCTIONS.md`](./docs/INSTRUCTIONS.md). This file defines:

* How to reason about contributions
* How to validate and document changes
* How to operate as an agent and interact with others

---

## 🏗️ Future Extensions

* Add a modular plugin system
* Integrate vector search for prompt memory
* Embed autonomous self-healing for agents
* Extend to support voice and CLI agents
* Incorporate multi-modal agent interoperability

## 👨‍💻 Human Contributors

Feel free to open issues, submit PRs, or build your own agents/modules. This system is designed to support **AI-human collaboration at scale**.
