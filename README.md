# AI-Model Marketplace OS

A turnkey platform that hosts, orchestrates, and monetizes any machine learning model (LLMs, vision, speech, RL agents) as modular services. Users can mount models via a unified CLI/UI, pay per inference or subscription, and switch seamlessly between providers.

## Features

* **Unified API Gateway**: gRPC + REST façade for all models.
* **Service Mesh**: Canary deployments, traffic shaping, and autoscaling with Istio.
* **Containerized Model Sandboxes**: Secure, lightweight runtimes with Firecracker and cgroups.
* **Real-Time Billing Engine**: Kafka-driven usage capture and billing microservice.
