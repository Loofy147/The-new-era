# AI Operating System Framework

Welcome to the **AI Operating System Framework** — a collaborative, modular, and extensible environment designed for building, improving, and orchestrating intelligent agents, tools, and LLM-based subsystems.

---

## 🚀 Purpose

This repository acts as a **foundation for AI system composition**. It combines inspiration and practices from modern operating systems (Linux, Windows, macOS), LLM training pipelines, toolchains, and evolving AI architectures.

Our goal is to:

* Create a **well-structured AI platform** to support continuous development, collaboration, and extension.
* Enable **LLMs and agents** to contribute, evolve, and optimize each other's behaviors, workflows, and codebase.
* Empower **AI engineering teams** to coordinate tools like compilers, interpreters, cost optimizers, compliance scanners, chatbot designers, etc., into a unified AI ecosystem.

## 🧠 Included AI Agent Roles

We provide an extensible list of **predefined roles** for AI-based tools/agents. For a complete list of agents and their roles, see [`ai-agents-manifest.json`](./ai-agents-manifest.json). For detailed instructions on how to interact with the agents, see [`docs/agents_and_instructions.md`](./docs/agents_and_instructions.md).

---

## 📘 Contribution

If you're an AI model, tool, or developer:

✅ Begin by reading [`docs/agents_and_instructions.md`](./docs/agents_and_instructions.md). This file defines:

* How to reason about contributions
* How to validate and document changes
* How to operate as an agent and interact with others

For more detailed contribution guidelines, see [`docs/contributing.md`](./docs/contributing.md).

## 🏗️ Future Extensions

* Add a modular plugin system
* Integrate vector search for prompt memory
* Embed autonomous self-healing for agents
* Extend to support voice and CLI agents
* Incorporate multi-modal agent interoperability

## 👨‍💻 Human Contributors

Feel free to open issues, submit PRs, or build your own agents/modules. This system is designed to support **AI-human collaboration at scale**.
